Legally, a narcotic drug could be an opiate (a true narcotic), cannabis (a non-narcotic) or cocaine (the very antithesis of a narcotic, since it is a stimulant). The term ‘psychotropic substance’ denotes mind-altering drugs such as Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), Phencyclidine, Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Methaqualone, and designer drugs (MDMA, DMT, etc.). \n[HEADING] 8\nFigure 8.1: Classification of drugs \n[HEADING] CLASSIFICATION OF DRUGS\n\n[HEADING] Narcotics\n\n[HEADING] Depressants\n\n[HEADING] Stimulants\n\n[HEADING] Hallucinogens\n● Opium ● Morphine ● Heroin ● Barbiturates ●",

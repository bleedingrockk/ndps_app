The Para 13 of the\njudgment is reproduced for reference,\n\"It appears from the Statement\nof Objects and Reasons of the\nAmending Act of 2001 that the\nintention of the legislature was to\nrationalize the sentence structure so as\nto ensure that while drug traffickers\nwho traffic in significant quantities of\ndrugs are punished with deterrent\nsentence, the addicts and those who\ncommit less serious offences are\nsentenced to less severe punishment.\nUnder the rationalised sentence\nstructure, the punishment would vary\ndepending upon the quantity of\noffending material. Thus, we find it\ndifficult to accept the argument\nadvanced on behalf of the respondent\nthat the rate of purity is irrelevant since\nany preparation which is more than the\ncommercial quantity of 250 gms. and\ncontains 0.2% of heroin or more would\nbe punishable under Section 21(c) of\nthe NDPS Act, because the intention of\nthe legislature as it appears to us is to\nlevy punishment based on the content\nof the offending drug in the mixture\n50\nNARCOTICS CONTROL BUREAU\nhttp://narcoticsindia.nic.in\n\n=== PAGE 78 ===\n\nand not on the weight of the mixture as\nsuch. This may be tested on the\nfollowing rationale. Supposing 4 gms.\nof heroin is recovered from an accused,\nit would amount to a small quantity,\nbut when the same 4 gms. is mixed\nwith 50 kgs. of the powered sugar, it\nwould be quantified as a commercial\nquantity. In the mixture of a narcotic\ndrug or a psychotropic substance with\none or more neutral substance/s, the\nquantity of the neutral substance/s is\nnot to be taken into consideration while\ndetermining the small quantity or\ncommercial quantity of a narcotic drug\nor psychotropic substance. It is only the\nactual content by weight of the narcotic\ndrug which is relevant for the purposes\nof determining whether it would\nconstitute\nsmall\nquantity\nor\ncommercial quantity. The intention of\nthe legislature for introduction of the\namendment as it appear to us is to\npunish the people who commit less\nserious offences with less severe\npunishment and those who commit\ngrave crimes, such as trafficking in\nsignificant quantities, with more severe\npunishment.\"\nHowever, vide notification\ndated\n18.11.2009 the DOR clarified the issue.",

Search or arrest -- Narcotics offences- -Police officer making a chance recovery of narcotics, in the normal course of investigation under the Cr.

C. Search or arrest -- Narcotics offences- -Non-compliance with provisions of Cr. P.C., Ss. 100 & 165 by an empowered or authorised officer, would amount to an \"irregularity\" but not vitiate the trial. D. Search -- Narcotics officer -- Empowered or authorised officer, acting on prior information -- Requirements of NDPS Act, S. 50 are mandatory -- Noncompliance would affect prosecution case and vitiate the trial.

It can be granted in case where there are reasonable grounds for believing that accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.

State of Maharashtr a | AIR 2000 SC 3203 | The Constitutional validity of Section 32-A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, was challenged. The section is alleged to be arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India which creates unreasonable distinction between the prisoners convicted under the Act and the prisoners convicted for the offences punishable under various other statutes. It was held that awarding sentence, upon conviction, is concededly a\n\n\n--- TABLE 40 ---\n |  |  |  | judicial function to be discharged by the Courts of law established in the country. It is always a matter of judicial discretion, however, subject to any mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by the Law. The award of sentence by a criminal court wherever made subject to the right of appeal cannot be interfered or intermeddled with in a way which amounts to not only interference but actually taking away the power of judicial review. Awarding the sentence and consideration of its legality or adequacy in appeal is essentially a judicial function embracing within its ambit the power to suspend the sentence under peculiar circumstances of each case, pending the disposal of the appeal. Not providing atleast one right of appeal, would negate the due process of law in the matter of dispensation of criminal justice. There is no doubt that the right of appeal is the creature of a statute and hence conferred, a substantive right. Providing a right of appeal but totally disarming the Court from granting interim relief in the form of suspension of sentence would be unjust, unfair and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution particularly when no mechanism is provided for early disposal of the appeal. The pendency of criminal litigation and the experience in dealing with pending matters indicate no possibility of early hearing of the appeal and its disposal on merits atleast in many High Courts.\n17 | 2000 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 41 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2000 | Superinten dent, Narcotics Central Bureau Vs.

The Supreme Court held that scheme of section 37 reveals that the exercise of the power to grant bail by the Special Judge is not only subject to the limitations contained under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C., but is also subject to the limitation placed by Section 37 which commences with nonobstante clause. The operative part of the said section is in negative in prescribing the enlargement of bail of any person accused of commission of an offence under the Act unless two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that prosecution must be given an opportunity to oppose the application and the second is that the Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence. If either of these two conditions is not satisfied, the ban for granting bail operates. As per the mandate of Section 37, no person accused of an offence punishable for a term of imprisonment of 5 years or more under the Act can be released on bail unless the conditions mentioned in subclauses (i) and (ii) of Clause (b) are satisfied.\n20 | 2001 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 44 ---\n21 | 2001 | State, Govt. of NCT of Delhi v.

If the Court finds at the final stage that the objection so raised is sustainable the Judge or Magistrate can keep such evidence excluded from consideration. In our view there is no illegality in adopting such a course.

This Court in various judgments while quashing the orders granting bail to accused of offence under the Act have cautioned the courts about the mandatory requirements of Section 37.\n | 2001 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 47 ---\n | 2001 | State of M.P.Vs.

A perusal of section 37 of the Act leaves no doubt in the mind of the court that a person accused of an offence, punishable for a term of imprisonment of five years or more, shall generally be not released on bail. Negation of bail is the rule and its grant an exception under sub clause (ii) of clause (b) of section 37(1). For granting the bail the court must, on the basis of the record produced before it, be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offences with which he is charged and further that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. It has further to be noticed that the conditions for granting the bail, specified in clause (b) of sub section (1) of section 37 are in addition to the\n |  |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 48 ---\n |  |  |  | limitations provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in force regulating the grant of bail.

If the search and seizure was in complete defiance of the law and procedure and there was any possibility of the evidence collected likely to have been tempered with or interpolated during the course of such search or seizure, then, it could be said the evidence is not liable to be admissible in evidence. ...... though the mahazar was not prepared at the spot where the accused persons were found to be in possession of the contraband article but the same was done only at the Office of the Customs Department while the accused persons were very much present throughout, there was no allegation or suggestion that the contraband article was, in any way, meddled with by the officers.

State of Himachal Pradesh | AIR2003 SC 3642 | Honorable Supreme Court held that the expression 'possession' is a polymorphous term which assumes different colours in different contexts. It may carry different meanings in contextually different backgrounds. It is impossible, as was observed in Superintendent & Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal v. Anil Kumar Bhunja and Ors.MANU/SC/0266/1979 : 1979 CriLJ1390 , to work out a completely logical and precise definition of \"possession\" uniformly applicable to all situations in the context of all statutes. The word 'conscious' means awareness about a particular fact. It is a state of mind which is deliberate orintended. Once possession is established the person who claims that it was not a conscious possession has to establish it, because how he came to be in possession is within his special knowledge. Section 35 of the Act gives a statutory recognition of this position because of presumption available in law. Similar is the position in terms of Section 54 where also presumption is available to be drawn from possession of illicit articles\n28 | 2003 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 52 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2003 | M.

Act with regard to enlarging of the accused on bail. There is no merit in contention that the learned Public Prosecutor did not oppose the bail as contained in Section 37(1)(b)(ii) of the N.D.P.S. Act. There is no substance in argument that , unless the Public Prosecutor opposes the bail application, Section 37 will not apply. It was contended that inasmuch as the Appellants have not put on record that the Public Prosecutor had opposed the granting of bail, it must be presumed that this is an order covered under Section 37(3) read with Section 439, Code of Criminal Procedure To say the least, the argument appears to be baseless. We cannot accept the contention that in a matter involving seizure of commercial quantity of a substance prohibited by the N.D.P.S. Act when the Public Prosecutor appears on notice of the bail application he would be standing there as a mute spectator not opposing the bail application unless he was at the back of the accused. We find no substance in this argument.\n38 | 2005 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 60 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2005 | State of Punjab Vs.

Irshad @ Shiv Raj vs State | Delhi High Court 134 (2006) DLT 507 | Honourable Delhi High Court held another aspect which has to be borne in mind is the consideration of Section 18 of the Juvenile Justice Act which shows that no juvenile, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or in any other law for the time being in force, shall be charged with or tried for any offence together with a person who is not a juvenile. Section 18(2) makes it the mandatory duty of the Juvenile Justice Board to direct separate trials for the juvenile and the other person. This makes it more than clear that a juvenile can be tried only in terms of the Juvenile Justice Act and that is before the Juvenile Justice Board. These provisions contained in the Juvenile Justice Act, form part of a beneficial\n\n\n--- TABLE 62 ---\n |  |  |  | legislation and are clear and mandatory. Moreover, in the view I have taken with regard to the sweep of the non obstante clauses in the two enactments, there is no conflict between the two special Acts. In view of the wordings of the provisions themselves as also the nature of the enactments, the Juvenile Justice Act would prevail.\n40 | 2006 |  | (2006) 13 एससीसी 229 | \n\n\n--- TABLE 63 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2006 | Ramjee Rai and Ors. State of Bihar | (2006)13SC C229 | Honourable Supreme Court held that :- (1) It is true that ordinarily the prosecution should examine all witnesses whose names have been disclosed in the charge-sheet ; but, then the same cannot be said to be a rule having universal application. Each case has to be considered on its own facts. (2)It is now well-settled that what is necessary for proving the prosecution case is not the quantity but quality of the evidence. The Court cannot overlook the changes in the value system in the society. When an offence is committed in a village owing to land dispute, the independent witnesses may not come forward. (3)Medical science has not achieved such perfection so as to enable a medical practitioner to categorically state in regard to the exact time of death. In a case of this nature, it was difficult to pinpoint the exact time of death. The autopsy surgeon told about the approximate time lag between the date of post-mortem examination and the likely date of death. He did not explain the basis for arriving at his opinion.\n41 | 2007 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 64 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2007 | State of Uttaranchal Vs.

It is for the limited purpose essentially confined to the question of releasing the accused on bail that the Court is called upon to see if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty and records its satisfaction about the existence of such grounds. But the Court has not to consider the matter as if it is pronouncing a judgment of acquittal and recording a finding of not guilty. No person shall be granted bail unless the two conditions are satisfied. They are; the satisfaction of the Court that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. Both the conditions have to be satisfied. If either of these two conditions is not satisfied, the bar operates and the accused cannot be released on bail\n43 | 2007 |  | (2007) 15 एससीसी 208 | \n\n\n--- TABLE 66 ---\n44 | 2007 2008 | Sayed Abul Ala Vs.

An initial burden exists upon the prosecution and only when it stands satisfied, would the legal burden shift. Even then, the standard of proof required for the accused to prove his innocence is not as high as that of the prosecution. Whereas the standard of proof required to prove the guilt of the accused on the prosecution is \"beyond all reasonable doubt\" but it is \"preponderance of probability\" on the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove the foundational facts so as to attract the rigours of Section 35 of the Act, the actus reus which is possession of contraband by the accused cannot be said to have been established.\n |  | Noor Aga v. Stateof Punjab |  | \n45 | 2008 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 68 ---\n |  |  |  | and not on the weight of the mixture as such. This may be tested on the following rationale. Supposing 4 gms. of heroin is recovered from an accused, it would amount to a small quantity, but when the same 4 gms. is mixed with 50 kgs. of the powered sugar, it would be quantified as a commercial quantity. In the mixture of a narcotic drug or a psychotropic substance with one or more neutral substance/s, the quantity of the neutral substance/s is not to be taken into consideration while determining the small quantity or commercial quantity of a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance. It is only the actual content by weight of the narcotic drug which is relevant for the purposes of determining whether it would constitute small quantity or commercial quantity. The intention of the legislature for introduction of the amendment as it appear to us is to punish the people who commit less serious offences with less severe punishment and those who commit grave crimes, such as trafficking in significant quantities, with more severe punishment.\" However, vide notification dated 18.11.2009 the DOR clarified the issue.\n46 | 2008 |  | (2008) 4 एससीसी 668. | \n\n\n--- TABLE 69 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2008 | Kanhaiyal al versus Union of India | (2008) 4 SCC 668. | Honourable Supreme Court held an officer vested with the powers of an Officer-in-charge of a Police Station under Section 53 of Act is not a 'Police Officer' within the meaning of Section 25 of Evidence Act - It is clear that a statement made under Section 67 of the N.D.P.S.

The Court has expressed deep concern for prolonged confinement of accused persons in jail in NDPS cases and non- commencement of trial for a long time. The Court has given some directions by way of present order for the speedy trial of the NDPS cases. 1. ADJOURNMENTS: The Court has expressed displeasure at the adjournments granted in the Courts in general and has directed that, grant adjournments at the request of a party except where the circumstances are beyond the control of the party. The Court has made a reference to the S.22 of the P.C. Act wherein the evidence\n\n\n--- TABLE 85 ---\n |  |  |  | applications for re-testing /re- sampling shall be entertained thereafter. 6. MONITORING: The Apex Court has directed that nodal officers be appointed in all the departments dealing with the NDPS Cases for monitoring of the progress of investigation and trial. This nodal officer must be equivalent to the rank of Superintendent of Police, who shall ensure that the trial is not delayed due to account of non-supply of documents, non-availability of the witnesses, or for any other reason. The Apex Court has also stated that there must be one Pairvi Officer or any other officer for each Court who shall report that days proceeding to the nodal officer assigned for each Court. 7. PUBLIC PROSECUTORS: The Apex Court has stressed upon the quality of the SPPs and directed that, the District and Sessions Judge shall make recommendations for such appointments in consultation with the Administrative Judge/Portfolio Judge/Inspecting Judge, in-charge of looking after the administration of the concerned SessionsDivision.\" 8. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: The Apex Court has observed that for simplification of the above detailed process, the filing of the charge-sheet and supply of the documents must also be provided in electronic form. However, the Court also directed that this must not be treated as a substitute for hard copies which are indispensable for Court proceedings.\n73 | 2013 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 86 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2013 | Sukhdev Singh Vs. State of Haryana | AIR2013SC 953 | Honourable Supreme Court held that section 42 of the N.D.P.S. Act, 1985 can be divided into two different parts. First is the power of entry, search seizure and arrest without warrant or authorization as contemplated under sub-section (1) of the said section. Second is reporting of the information reduced to writing to a higher officer in consonance with sub-section (2) of that section, Sub-section (2) of Section 42 had been a matter of judicial interpretation as well as of legislative concern in the past Sub-section (2) was amended by the Parliament vide Act 9 of 2001 with effect from 2nd October. 2001. After amendment of this sub- section, the words 'forthwith' stood amended by the words 'within 72 hours'. In other words, whatever ambiguity or leverage was provided for under the unamended provision was clarified and resultantly, absolute certainty was brought in by binding the officer concerned to send the intimation to the superior officers within 72 hours from the time of receipt of information. The amendment is suggestive of the legislative intent that information must reach the superior officer not only expeditiously or forthwith but definitely within the time contemplated under the amended sub-section (2) of Section 42. This, provides a greater certainty to the time in which the action should be taken as well as renders the safeguards provided to an accused more meaningful.

But if the search is made by an officer authorized under Section 41(2) of the Act then the said officer is said to be acting under Section 41(2) and therefore compliance under Section 42 is not necessary at all. This principle is reiterated in the case of M. Prabhulal v. The Assistant Director, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence,\n |  |  |  | (2003) 8 SCC 449 and in Mohd. Hussain Farah v. Union of India &\n |  |  |  | Anr.,2001 1 SCC 329, wherein it is observed that a gazetted officer is an empowered officer and so when a search is carried out in his presence and under his supervision, the provision of Section 42 has no application.\n83 | 2014 |  | 2014 (4) स्केल 58 | \n\n\n--- TABLE 94 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2014 | Union of India Vs.

There is yet another reason apart from the construction of the language of Section 23 which compels us to accept the submission made by the learned counsel for the respondent. Section 9(1)(a)(vii) also employs the expression transhipment.

State of Punjab, 2013 1 RCR (Cri) 428 considered the question as to whether a wholesale drug dealer, a retailer and their employees possessing proper and valid licence for dealing in drugs specified in Schedule C and Schedule C1 as well as drugs not specified in those Schedules of the D&C Act and the 1945 Rules can be held liable for an offence punishable under the NDPS Act. After making a reference to Section 80 NDPS Act, it was held that a person can very well be prosecuted both under the NDPS Act as well as under the D&C Act simultaneously for violation of the provisions of the said Acts. It was held that merely because a person is prosecuted for violation of D&C Act that would not operate as a bar to prosecute him under the provisions of the NDPS Act. Rather if the offences made out under the D&C Act also comes within the scope of the provisions of the NDPS Act such person shall be prosecuted for possession of the contrabands violating the provisions of the NDPS Act. Both the Acts, it was held are independent and violation of one Act does not mean no violation of the other. Therefore, merely, because prosecution is launched and trial is conducted under the NDPS Act, which is considered a harsher and an onerous provision, the initiation of the proceedings cannot be said to be improper or bad. In case it is done for any extraneous reasons or circumstances or with a mala fide\n\n\n--- TABLE 100 ---\n |  |  |  | intention, the same would of course be subject to judicial scrutiny and review. In the circumstances, when there has been a contravention of a certain manufactured drug or a psychotropic substance and which falls within the purview of NDPS Act and the NDPS Rules, the possession, sale and transportation of which is prohibited, or is being done without proper licence or with no proper authorization, the prosecution under the provisions of the NDPS Act would not be prohibited and it cannot be said to be in any manner illegal.\n88 | 2016 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 101 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2016 | Union of India v/s Mohanlal & Anr (Crl. Appeal 652/2012) | (2016) 3 SCC 379 | The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the present matter had taken cognizance of the fact that a lot of seized contraband is being kept with the Central and State agencies and that the efforts taken towards the destruction of such contraband are not adequate. The Court has observed that the contraband is finding its way back into the society. After careful scrutiny of the collected data from different agencies and High Courts in regard to seizure, storage, disposal and destruction of the seized contraband, the Court has delivered a judgment on these aspects of NDPS law. The Court has observed that S.52 A requires that no sooner the seizure is done, the contraband is to be forwarded to the officer in charge of a police station or the officer empowered. Such an officer is then duty bound to approach the Magistrate for drawing samples and getting them certified. The Court passed directions that the agencies will store the seized contraband as per the directions issued in NCB Standing order 1/89. The Court also ordered that the storage facilities will be upgraded at the State and Central level and will be placed under the overall supervision of a gazetted officer and put under double lock system and etc. The Court has also observed that periodical inspection of the storage facilities is also missing. Disposal 1 Destruction of NDPSsubstances With regards to the disposal of seized\n\n\n--- TABLE 102 ---\n |  |  |  | contraband and conveyances the Court stated the following àm Cases where Trial is concluded and proceedings in appeal / revision have all concluded (if any before29.5.1989) : The Court states that in cases that stood finally concluded at Trial, appeal, revision and further appeals, if any before 29.5.1989, the continued storage of NDPS, controlled substances and conveyances is of no consequence and has thus directed that all the Drugs Disposal Committees of the States and the Central agencies shall take stock of all such seized contrabands and take steps for their disposal without any further verification. àm Drugs that are seized after May, 1989 and where Trial and proceedings in appeal /revision have all concluded:\n |  |  |  | This is the category of seizures that have been undertaken after introduction of S. 52 A. In this category of the cases Court has opined that it will be a futile exercise if the drugs are tested as per Para 5.5. of SO 1/89. The Court has thus directed that all the Drugs Disposal Committees shall take stock of all such seized contrabands in which trial has concluded\n |  |  |  | àm Cases where proceedings are still pending before Trial Court, Appellate Courts or before the Supreme Court :\n |  |  |  | The Court has directed that in all such cases the Head of the Department shall ensure the filing of appropriate applications under the notification dated 16.1.2015 without any further loss of time.\n\n\n--- TABLE 103 ---\n89 | 2017 |  | (2017) 11 एससीसी 290 | \n | 2017 | Dibagh Singh Vs.

Whereas the Trial Court, upon the entering finding of guilt had sentenced the accused persons with rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and six months each and fine of Rs.1 lac each with default sentence of rigorous imprisonment for one year, the High Court in appeal has confirmed the verdict in toto by the decision impugned herein.\n90 | 2018 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 104 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2018 | Salim Jamshed Ali Shaikh Vs.

Act, i.e. oral and in writing and if either of the appraisals are proved to be given in compliance of and in conformity with Section-50 of the Act, then the same can be safely relied upon. In the present case though the oral appraisal given to the appellant was a joint appraisal, the letters of appraisal in writing were individual to the accused persons and the same have been proved to be in compliance of Section 50 of the Act.\n91 | 2018 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 105 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2018 | Himachal Pradesh State vs. Pradeep Kumar & Anr. | AIR 2018 SC 1345 | Honourable Supreme Court held that The judgment of acquittal by the High Court is in reversal of the conviction recorded by learned trial Court which had imposed a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for 12 years and fine of Rs. 1,50,000/- on each of the accused. On default of payment of the fine amount, it was ordered by the learned trial Court that the accused- Respondents will suffer imprisonment for a further period of one year. examination of independent witnesses is not an indispensable requirement and such non-examination is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution case. In the present case, according to the prosecution, independent witnesses\n\n\n--- TABLE 106 ---\n |  |  |  | were not available to witness the recovery of the contraband due to extreme cold. In the absence of any animosity between the police party and the accused and having regard to the large quantity of contraband that was recovered (18.85 Kgs.), we are of the view that it is unlikely that the contraband had been planted/foisted in the vehicle of the accused persons. Insofar as the condition of the contraband parcel is concerned, the materials on record indicate that the said parcel was brought to the learned trial Court on 15.9.2009 in a torn condition.\n92 | 2018 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 107 ---\n93 | 2018 2018 | Arif Khan @Agha Khan v/s State of Uttrakhan d | Criminal Appeal No. 273 of 2007 | The case is of Uttrakhand police, where on the basis of a secret information the accused was apprehended with 2.5 Kgs of charas. The accused was informed by the Police u/s 50 NDPS Act, 1985 that he has a legal right to be searched in the presence of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate to which the accused replied in writing that he has faith on the raiding party and they can search him. The trial Court convicted the accused and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine of Rs.1,00,000/. The said sentence was confirmed by the High Court.

The State of Punjab | AIR 2018 SC 3798 (3 Judges) | Honourable Supreme Court held, while allowing the appeal: (i) For proving the offence under the NDPS Act, it is necessary for the prosecution to establish that the quantity of the contraband goods allegedly seized from the possession of the Accused and the best evidence would be the court records as to the production of the contraband before the Magistrate and deposit of the same before the Malkhana or the document showing destruction of the contraband. [12] (ii) The High Court appears to have gone by the oral evidence of prosecution witnesses that the contraband allegedly seized from the Accused was produced before the Magistrate. When the trial court which was in possession of the case records recorded a finding that there was no order of the Magistrate showing the production of the contraband before the court and acquitted the Accused on that basis, the High Court ought not to have interfered with the said order of acquittal. [14] (iii) The findings of the trial court could not be said to be distorted conclusions warranting interference. Based on the oral evidence of prosecution witnesses, the High Court ought not to have interfered with the order of acquittal and the conviction of the Appellant under Section 18 of the NDPS Act could not be sustained.

It, however, mentioned that where the accused fails to apply for default bail and when the right accrues to him, subsequently a charge sheet, additional complaint or a report seeking an extension of time is preferred before the Magistrate; the right to default bail would be extinguished. The Magistrate would be at liberty to take cognizance of the case or grant further time for completion of the investigation, as the case may be, though the accused may still be released on bail under other provisions of the CrPC. It ordered that notwithstanding the order of default bail passed by the Court, the actual release of the accused from custody is contingent on the directions passed by the competent Court granting bail. If the accused fails to furnish bail and/or comply with the terms and conditions of the bail order within the time stipulated by the Court, his continued detention in custody is valid.\n121 | 2021 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 128 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2021 | Mohd.

Such accused causes deleterious effects and deadly impact on the society. They are hazard to the society. Such organized activities of clandestine smuggling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into this country and illegal trafficking in such drugs and substances have a deadly impact on the society as a whole. Therefore, while awarding the sentence or punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is required to be taken into consideration. Therefore, even while applying discretion under Section 427 of Cr.PC, the discretion shall not be in favour of the accused who is found to be indulging in illegal trafficking in the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. As observed hereinabove, even while exercising discretion under Section 427 of Cr.PC to run subsequent sentence concurrently with the previous sentence, the discretion is to be exercised judiciously and depending upon the offence/offences committed. Therefore, considering the offences under the NDPS Act which are very serious in nature and against the society at large, no discretion shall be exercised in favour of such accused who is indulging into the offence under the NDPS Act. \"\n122 | 2021 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 130 ---\n |  |  |  | \n | 2021 | Aryan S Khan vs Union of India | Criminal Bail Application No. 3624 of 2021 | Honorable BOM HC recently clarified that Statements recorded under Section 67 of NDPS Act can be used for Investigation purposes but not as confessional statement and only material against the Accused.\n123 | 2021 |  |  | \n | 2021 | Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigati on | SLP (Crl.) No. 5191 of 2021 | In this judgment, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down guidelines for grant of bail by lower courts. The guidelines are issued to fill the lacuna in the intervening period between the completion of investigation and the initiation of trial, that is, the stage when investigation has concluded and chargesheet/complaint has been filed, but the accused was not arrested during the investigation. Hon'ble Supreme Court has categorized the offences for grant of bail.\n\n\n--- TABLE 131 ---\n124 | 2021 |  | 2021 की | \n |  |  |  | \n | 2021 | Union of India V. Prateek Shukla | Criminal Appeal No 284 of 2021 | Hon'ble Supreme Court cancelled the bail of the accused for violation of RCS Order and possession of Acetic Anhydride.\n125 | 2021 |  |  | \n | 2021 | Union of India through Narcotics Control Bureau vs Md. Nawaz Khan | Criminal Appeal No. 1043 of 2021 | Hon'ble Supreme Court held that mere absence of contraband with the accused does become a solitary reason for granting bail. Even after the bail was granted, the accused avoided criminal trials and it became difficult for framing relevant issues. Hence, the Court held that the High Court did not give due weight to the magnitude of the offence and its impact and set aside the High Court order.

The recovery was not in person. Learned counsel seeks to expand the scope of the observations made by seeking to contend that if the personal search is vitiated by violation of Section 50 of the NDPS Act, the recovery made otherwise also would stand vitiated and thus, cannot be relied upon. We cannot give such an extended view as is sought to be contended by learned counsel for the appellant.\"\n\n\n--- TABLE 133 ---\n127 128 | 2022 |  |  | \n | 2022 | Sukhdev Singh vs. State of Punjab | CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1004 OF 2016 | While hearing a case of non- compliance of NDPS Act, the Supreme Court has held that physical nature of the material is not relevant for determining whether the contents of the sample analyzed were actually opium or not, and physical analysis is not prescribed under the provisions of the NDPS Act for testing the opium.\n | 2022 |  |  | \n\n\n--- TABLE 134 ---\n |  |  |  | \n129 | 2022 | Sanjeev & Anr. Versus State Of Himachal Pradesh | Criminal Appeal No.870 Of 2016; March 09, 2022 | Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the personal search did not result in recovery of any contraband material but the non- compliance of requirement of affording an option to be searched before a Magistrate of a competent Gazetted Officer - Accused acquitted. Reasons which had weighed with the Trial Court in acquitting the accused must be dealt with, in case the appellate Court is of the view that the acquittal rendered by the Trial Court deserves to be upturned - With an order of acquittal by the Trial Court, the normal presumption of innocence in a criminal matter gets reinforced - If two views are possible from the evidence on record, the appellate Court must be extremely slow in interfering with the appeal against acquittal.\n | 2022 |  |  | \n | 2022 | Ghulam Mohd. Bhat vs. NCB | Bail App. No. 409/2021 | The Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh High Court recently held that the officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau are police officers within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act.

Md. Jamal | Criminal Appeal No 752 of 2022 | In this case, Hon'ble Supreme Court cancelled the bail of the accused on the ground that the High Court failed to apply the twin conditions of section 37 of NDPS Act. Hon'ble SC further held that ex facie , the\n\n\n--- TABLE 136 ---\n132 |  |  |  | impugned order of the High Court does not consider the provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act.

There is no bar on search before such officer and no law prescribes that he(suspect/accused) should be subjected to the personal search in the presence of the Gazetted Officer not belonging to the particular department.\n\n\n--- TABLE 137 ---\n133 | 2022 |  |  | \n | 2022 | Narcotics Control Bureau v. Mohit Aggarwal | Criminal Appeal Nos. 1001-1002 of 2022 | Hon'ble Supreme Court in this case summed up that the expression \"reasonable grounds\" used in clause (b) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 37 would mean credible, plausible grounds for the Court to believe that the accused person is not guilty of the alleged offence. For arriving at any such conclusion, such facts and circumstances must exist in a case that can persuade the Court to believe that the accused person would not have committed such an offence. At the stage of examining an application for bail in the context of the Section 37 of the Act, the Court is not required to record a finding that the accused person is not guilty. The entire exercise that the Court is expected to undertake at this stage is for the limited purpose of releasing him on bail. Thus, the focus is on the availability of reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offences that he has been charged with and he is unlikely to commit an offence under the Act while on bail.",
